Imagetect
Overview
Imagetect is a versatile, client-side web application designed to provide a suite of powerful image manipulation tools. Built with simplicity and efficiency in mind, it allows users to perform various image processing tasks directly in their browser, ensuring privacy and speed as no files are uploaded to a server.

This project was developed with assistance from an AI programming partner.

Current Features
Image Compressor: Upload an image and specify a target size (in KB or MB). Imagetect uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the image to meet your exact requirements, providing a preview of both the original and compressed versions.

Future Development
Imagetect is designed to be an expandable platform for image utilities. Future updates will introduce a range of new tools, including:

Image Converter: Convert images between different formats (e.g., PNG, JPG, WEBP).

Bulk Resizer: Resize multiple images to specific dimensions at once.

Watermarking Tool: Add custom text or image watermarks to your pictures.

Filter Library: Apply a variety of filters and effects.
