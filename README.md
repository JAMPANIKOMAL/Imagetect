# Imagetect

## Overview

Imagetect is a versatile, client-side web application designed to provide a suite of powerful image manipulation tools. Built with simplicity and efficiency in mind, it allows users to perform various image processing tasks directly in their browser, ensuring privacy and speed as no files are uploaded to a server.

This project was developed with assistance from an AI programming partner.

## Current Features

*   **Image Compressor:** Upload an image and specify a target size (in KB or MB). Imagetect uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the image to meet your exact requirements, providing a preview of both the original and compressed versions.

## How to Use the Compressor

2.  **Set Target Size:** Enter your desired file size in the "Target Size" input field and select the appropriate unit (KB or MB).
3.  **Compress:** Click the "Compress" button to start the process.
4.  **Preview & Download:** Once complete, you will see a preview of the compressed image along with its new size. You can then click the "Download Image" button to save it.
5.  **(Optional) Set Output Filename:** A new input field will appear with the download button. You can enter a custom name for the compressed file before downloading.
6.  **Download:** Click the "Download Image" button to save your compressed file.

## Technology Stack

*   **Bulk Resizer:** Resize multiple images to specific dimensions at once.
